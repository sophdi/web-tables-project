# web-tables-project


## Description  
This project is a demonstration of creating stylized HTML tables using CSS for formatting. It includes three main pages: two tables with different structures and styling, and a table designed in the style of Piet Mondrian, a renowned abstract artist. The project showcases the capabilities of HTML and CSS in working with nested tables, cell merging, and custom styles.
